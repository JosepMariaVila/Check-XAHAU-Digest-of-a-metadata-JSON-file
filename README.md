Just place the JSON file you want to know the Digest in  the same folder where the sha512half.js file is. 
In this example the file we want to know the Digest is JSONexample.json

Put the name of the JSON file in the field indicated in the sha512half.js file (line 2 in this case)
In this example the name is JSONexample.json

Run the sha512half.js in the terminal: node sha512half.js 

In this case, for the JSONexample.json file the terminal returns the following Digest:
43d607e0f5d24cc86d6d54c38425ec12fe1bb01edc9200ede68f0f87d92dfe59
(in some places the Digest appears with capital letters)
